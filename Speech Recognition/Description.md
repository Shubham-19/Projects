# Speech Recognition using Python3
This project demonstrates how we can use Python3 to perform some of the basic functions such as:
1. Getting input from the user using microphone.
2. Translating that input to some other language.
3. Getting our program to 'speak'(respond in automatic voice)

## Note
This program requires a high speed internet connection as it uses Google's Speech to Text API
